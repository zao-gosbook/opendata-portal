IP GEOLOCATION VIEWS AND MAPS
=============================
This documentation concentrates on the installation and configuration of the
IP Geolocation Views & Maps (IPGV&M) module. A full description of the module
and its features can be found at http://drupal.org/project/ip_geoloc.

INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION
============================
First, if you are using IPGV&M primarily for its Views mapping interface to
other modules and the features it adds, then here's a configuration shortcut.
Download and enable IPGV&M like any other module. Visit its
configuration page, .../admin/config/system/ip_geoloc.
If you intend to use IPGV&M's built-in interface to Google Maps, untick all
"Data collection option" boxes.
If you intend to use IPGV&M with the OpenLayers module and also wish to
show and center on the visitor's HTML-5 retrieved location, then you do need to
tick the first "Data collection option" and select applicable roles below it.

You are now ready to map your View of Location, Geofield, Geolocation Field or
GetLocations data and optionally center that map on the visitor's location.
Visit the IPGV&M configuration page to specify an alternative marker set. When
using Leaflet you can superimpose Font Awesome font characters on top of your
markers.

If you want to center the map on the visitor's location, but don't want to use
the HTML5 style of location retrieval involving a browser prompt, you may want
to configure an alternative lat/long lookup based on IP address. For this follow
installation instruction B1a or B1b below, depending on whether you'd like to
employ Smart IP or GeoIP for this.

If you DO want to auto-record visitor address details then complete the steps
under A and B below.

A. Present and future: reporting and mapping of location information about
guests visiting after you enabled IPGV&M

1. Install and enable like any other module, use Drush if you wish. Remain
connected to the internet.

2. Make sure the core Statistics module is enabled. Then at Configuration >>
Statistics, section System, verify that the access log is enabled. Select the
"Discard access logs older than" option as you please. "Never" is good.

3. Visit the IPGV&M configuration page at Configuration >> IP Geolocation V&M
If you don't see any errors or warnings (usually yellow) you're
good to proceed. Don't worry about any of the configuration options for now,
the defaults are fine.

4. At Structure >> Blocks put the block "Map showing locations of 10 most recent
visitors" in the content region of all or a selected page. View the page. That
marker represents you (or your service provider). Clicking the marker reveals
more details.

5. Enable the Views and Views PHP (http://drupal.org/project/views_php) modules.
Then have a look at Structure >> Views for a couple of handy Views, e.g. the
"Visitor log", which shows for each IP address that visited, its street address,
as well as a local map. Or "Visitor log (lite)", which combines nicely when put
on the same page with the "Map showing locations of 10 most recent visitors".
Modify these views as you please.


B. Historic data: location info about visits to your site from way back when

Note, that this step relies on you having had the Statistics module enabled
before you installed IPGV&M, as the access log is used as the source of IP
addresses that have visited your site previously.
There are a couple of options here. Use either
http://drupal.org/project/smart_ip and the IPinfoDB web service it uses, or
http://drupal.org/project/geoip, which takes its data from a file you download
for free.

1a. If you decide to employ Smart IP....
Install and enable Smart IP. There is no need to enable the Device Geolocation
submodule as IPGV&M already has that functionality, plus more. At
Configuration >> Smart IP you'll find two options to upload historic lat/long
data. The one using the IPinfoDB web service is probably the quickest. The API
key required on the Smart IP configuration page is free and is sent to you
immediately by return email after you have filled out the short form at
http://ipinfodb.com/register.php. On the Smart IP configuration page perform an
IP lookup to verify that the key is correct.

1b. If you decide to employ GeoIP instead of Smart IP...
Download and enable the module. Then download and uncompress
http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz and place
it in sites/all/libraries/geoip. Go to the GeoIP configuration page and type
the name of the file you've just downloaded, GeoLiteCity.dat. Save. That should
be it.

2. With either Smart IP or GeoIP configured, visit Configuration >> IPGV&M.
Tick the check boxes as appropriate.

3. On the same page, start a small batch import of, say, size 10. Data for the
most recent visitors will be loaded first, so you don't have to complete the
import to check it's all working. For instance, the block "Map showing locations
of 10 most recent visitors" should now show more markers.

4. Go back the Configuration >> IPGV&M and complete the import process
with a larger batch size until the IP geolocation database is up to date with
the access log. It will automatically remain in synch from now on.

CONFIGURING YOUR VIEW TO DISPLAY AS A MAP
=========================================
If you have one of the Location, Geofield, Geolocation Field or Get Locations
modules enabled, then first create a normal tabular content View of nodes that
hold location coordinates via one of these modules. The coordinates will show up
in the Field list of your View.
Unless you use the Location module (with User Locations or Node Locations), make
sure you have included in your view's field selection a field named "Content:
your_Geofield/Geolocation_field". Only one copy is required, you do NOT need
both a latitude version plus a longitude version. The "Formatter", if it pops
up, is relevant only if you want the location field to appear in the marker
balloons. Make sure "Use field template" is UNTICKED.
Then, after selecting the View Format "Map (Google, via IPGV&M)", "Map (Leaflet,
via IPGV&M)" or "Map (OpenLayers, via IPGV&M)" select or type field_name in the
"Name of latitude field in Views query".
Fill out the remaining options to your liking. Save. Done.

LEAFLET TIPS
============
You need to download and install the Leaflet package on your system, but you
only have to enable the main module, no need for the Leaflet Views submodule.
Don't forget to download the Leaflet javascript library from
http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/download.html. This zip file contains a directory
named 'dist'. Drop this directory in your Drupal install in
sites/all/libraries/leaflet, so that the path to the essential javascript file
becomes sites/all/libraries/leaflet/dist/leaflet.js
Remember to install and enable the Libraries API module too. If all's ok, you
won't see any errors in the Status Report, .../admin/reports/status.

OPENLAYERS TIPS
===============
Of the modules in the OpenLayers package you only need to enable OpenLayers and
OpenLayers UI. In fact, you could even disable OpenLayers UI when you're done
configuring your maps.
Initially the location markers are likely to show up as black circles. To
change the marker shapes and colours you need to first associate the "Location
markers" layer with your map at Structure >> OpenLayers >> Maps >> List. If
there is no custom map on this page yet, you have to first clone and save under
a different name one of the existing maps. Once you've done that, you'll find
that on Structure >> OpenLayers >> Maps >> List the map appears with an Edit
link. Click that, followed by the "Layers & Styles" vertical tab. In the bottom
section of the page you'll find the "Current visitor marker" layer and a number
of "Location markers" layers. You'll only need to activate Location markers #1,
unless you have defined a "differentiator" (e.g. taxonomy term) on your view.
Pick marker styles from the drop-downs as you please and press Save. Note that
the location markers won't show up in the map preview, but the visitor marker
should. This is because the map doesn't know which view it will be paired with.
In fact there may be several views using the same map. Return to edit your view.
Under Format, Settings select the map you've just created and edited. Save the
format and the view. Visit the page containing your view and all markers should
appear in the colours you chose.
In order to make the text balloons pop up at a marker when hovered or clicked,
visit Structure >> OpenLayers >> Maps >> Edit and click the "Behaviors"
vertical tab. Scroll down the page until you reach the "Pop Up for Features"
check box. Tick it and select the layers you're interested with, e.g.
ip_geoloc_visitor_marker_layer1 and/or ip_geoloc_marker_layer. Same for
"Tooltip for Features". Other nice behaviors that you may wish to flick on on
the same page are "Full Screen", "Layer Switcher", "Pan and Zoom Bar Controls"
and "Scale Line".

ALTERNATIVE MARKER ICONS (LEAFLET, GOOGLE MAPS)
===============================================
Find on the web a marker icon set you like, eg http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com
Download and extract the icon image files, which must have extension .png,
into a directory anywhere in your Drupal instal,
e.g. sites/default/files/map_markers.

Now visit the the IP Geolocation Views & Maps configuration page at
admin/config/system/ip_geoloc. Expand the "Alternative markers" fieldset.
Enter the path to your map_markers directory and the dimensions of your markers.
The marker set will now be available in your map settings, in particular in the
differentiator settings.

"FONT AWESOME" ICONS SUPERIMPOSED ON YOUR MARKER IMAGES (LEAFLET)
=================================================================
To install Font Awesome visit http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome and
press the "Download" button. Unzip the downloaded file into the Drupal
libraries directory, typically sites/all/libraries, so that the path to the
essential style sheet becomes
sites/all/libraries/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
=================
First of all, check out file ip_geoloc_api.inc for a number of useful utility
functions for creating maps and markers, calculating distances between locations
etc. All functions are documented and should be straightforward to use.

HOOKS (see ip_geoloc.api.php)
=============================
To add, change or remove marker locations from the View-based set, you can
implement hook_ip_geoloc_marker_locations_alter(&$marker_locations, &$view).
Each element in the &marker_locations array is an object with the following
fields:

  $marker_location->latitude
  $marker_location->longitude
  $marker_location->marker_color
  $marker_location->balloon_text

The $marker_location->marker_color has to be the name (without extension) of one
of the files in the ip_geoloc/markers directory, or alternative, if configured
at admin/config/system/ip_geoloc.
The code below changes the color of the first two markers returned by the View
to orange and yellow and then prepends an additional marker, not in the View.
Because the marker is added at the front of the location array, the map can be
centered on it. Or you can choose one of the other centering options, as per
normal.

<?php
/**
 * Implements hook_ip_geoloc_marker_locations_alter().
 */
function MYMODULE_ip_geoloc_marker_locations_alter(&$marker_locations, &$view) {
  if ($view->name != 'my_view') {
    return;
  }
  if (count($marker_locations) >= 2) {
    $marker_locations[0]->marker_color = 'orange';
    $marker_locations[1]->marker_color = 'yellow';
  }
  $observatory = new stdClass();
  $observatory->latitude = 51.4777;
  $observatory->longitude = -0.0015;
  $observatory->balloon_text = t('The zero-meridian passes through the courtyard of the <strong>Greenwich</strong> observatory.');
  $observatory->marker_color = 'white';
  array_unshift($marker_locations, $observatory);
}
?>

If you want to hook your own gelocation data provider into IP Geolocation, then
you can -- it's simple, using another hook.
All you have to do is flesh out the following function.

<?php
/**
 * Implements hook_get_ip_geolocation_alter().
 */
function MYMODULE_get_ip_geolocation_alter(&$location) {

  if (empty($location['ip_address'])) {
    return;
  }
  // ... your code here to retrieve geolocation data ...
  $location['provider'] = 'MYMODULE';

  // Fill out some or all of the location fields that IPGV&M knows how to store.
  $location['latitude'] = ;
  $location['longitude'] = ;
  $location['country'] = ;
  $location['country_code'] = ;
  $location['region'] = ;
  $location['region_code'] = ;
  $location['city'] = ;
  // 'locality' is usually the suburb.
  $location['locality'] = ;
  // 'route' is usually the street.
  $location['route'] = ;
  $location['street_number'] = ;
  $location['postal_code'] = ;
  // 'administrative_area_level_1' is usually the state or province.
  $location['administrative_area_level_1'] = ;
  // Finally the complete address as a human-readable string.
  $location['formatted_address'] = ;
}
?>

That's all!
Note that when IPGV&M calls this function the $location object may be
partially fleshed out. If $location['ip_address'] is empty, this means that
IPGV&M is still waiting for more details to arrive from the Google
reverse-geocoding AJAX call. If $location['ip_address'] is not empty, then
IPGV&M does not expect any further details and will store the $location
with your modifications (if any) on the IP geolocation database. You must set
$location['formatted_address'] in order for the location to be stored.

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY GOOGLE
==============================
Taken from http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding :

"Use of the Google Geocoding API is subject to a query limit of 2500 geolocation
requests per day. (Users of Google Maps API Premier may perform up to 100,000
requests per day.) This limit is enforced to prevent abuse and/or repurposing of
the Geocoding API, and this limit may be changed in the future without notice.
Additionally, we enforce a request rate limit to prevent abuse of the service.
If you exceed the 24-hour limit or otherwise abuse the service, the Geocoding
API may stop working for you temporarily. If you continue to exceed this limit,
your access to the Geocoding API may be blocked.
Note: the Geocoding API may only be used in conjunction with a Google map;
geocoding results without displaying them on a map is prohibited. For complete
details on allowed usage, consult the Maps API Terms of Service License
Restrictions."
